# Ethereum Gas Price Prediction
Interest in cryptocurrency is hot these days. Cryptocurrency is a combination of crypto, which
means encryption, and currency, which is a virtual asset that can be safely transmitted through
public key encryption in a distributed ledger and easily prove ownership using hash functions. In
general, cryptocurrency operates based on blockchain, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are
representatives.

In the case of Ethereum, you have to pay a kind of fee when exchanging coins or signing a smart
contract. The fee at this time is called the ‘Gas Fee’. The cost of this gas fluctuates from time to
time, as the network becomes congested, the cost of gas increases and vice versa. By introducing
these gas costs, Ethereum plays a role in preventing network overload due to transactions. As many
people make transactions in the Ethereum network, gas costs have become more and more
important. The amount can be determined by the user who generates the transaction, such as paying
a high gas bill for those who want to their transaction to be executed quickly and paying a low gas
bill for those who do not. In general, many people want fast transmission speed, so the burden of
paying for gas is bound to increase. With this in mind, we tried to predict the changing gas cost
through time-series analysis so that the gas cost could be more affordable.
